# Simple MVC
An MVC that's writen in PHP designed to not use composer or curl,
The reason for all of this is for simplicity and ease of use.

# TODOs
Currently There's nothing for a templatting engine, there's no way to access a database, and there isn't much for debugging. Once I get all those in here I'll be able to do much more :3

Help is appreciated.
